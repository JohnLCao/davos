quick and dirty ruby REPL to help me organize my stuff.

# Story

Oct. 2017. Since classes resumed I have been consistently late to my db class. One day I was particularly upset with myself and 
my disorganization, so I decided to give it a think. 1 thing was that when things get rolling and there are multiple things to do, often 
I wouldn't be able to decide which to do and would end up just watching rick and morty. Quite literally the starving donkey between two 
bales of hay. 

So I decided to make a simple repl tool that ideally will report to me exactly what I shold be doing next, based on some custom definition
of priority.
